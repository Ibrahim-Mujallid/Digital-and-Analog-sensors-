# Digital-and-Analog-sensors-
Objective : Deasign and programm Electronic circuit to oberate Digital and Analog Sensors using Arduino 
Description: First in analog Sensor I used Temperature Sensor and Connected it to Arduino as in the picture , there is a picture show that the sensor is reading the temperature (in serial monitor) which mean is workimg very will , used components : Arduino UNO,temperature sensor 
Second in Digital sensor I used IR sensor and connectrd it to arduino and to show that the sensor is working very will there is picture to reading from ir Remote which mean the sensor is working and can take reading from  ir remote  
 used components: arduino UNO,IR sensor, ir remote
